# 3-2-1 Sketch!
This game was built with React, Node, Express, and Socket io.
Inspired by the hit board game "how do you doodle" I built this game to play with family after our game was tragically lost to my cousins in Kansas City.
## how to play

each round the players are given a card with three items. Each Player is
        given one of the three items, highlighted in blue, to draw and is given
        45 seconds to draw it. Since each of the three items are very similar
        you'll have to think outside the box to make sure the other players can
        differenciate your item from the others. Experiment with your
        imagination! After the time runs out players vote. Points are scored by
        correctly guessing others drawings and other players correctly guess
        what you drew. Points are also lost if you incorrectly guess other
        players' drawings. Voting on a player's sketch is not mandatory so in
        some cases it is more beneficial to not vote in order to retain
        potentially lost points. No drawing words or talking whilst voting. Most
        importantly have fun!
